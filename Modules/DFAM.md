# Concept

[[DFAM]] is the first addition to the [[Mother-32]] family of synthesizers ([[Eurorack module]]) and presents an expressive hands-on approach to percussive pattern creation. It requires no patching ([[Sequencer]], [[Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)]], [[Eurorack voice]]), and absolutely no experience is needed for human-beings of any age to quickly begin synthesizing new and unique rhythmic compositions.
