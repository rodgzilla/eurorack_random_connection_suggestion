# Concept

[[Pamela's PRO workout]] is a compact programmable clocked modulation source ([[Clock]]) for your Eurorack modular [[Synthesizer]] system ([[Eurorack module]]). It provides 8 highly editable outputs producing various control voltage signals, all correlated and synced to a BPM based master clock.
