# Concept

[[Ruina Versio]] answers the age-old question: how many different types of [[Distortion]] can we fit on a single module? The answer is a lot, as it turns out. Need a [[Wavefolder]]? We got a [[Wavefolder]]. Want some multiband [[Distortion]]? Of course you do! And that’s not even including the DOOM parameter! We also decided that Smoosh was a parameter we needed in our lives: press it and add 128dB of drive. Yes, you read that right: 128dB. Why have SOME drive when you can have ALL the drive?
