# Concept

The [[Disting EX]] is a multifunction [[Eurorack module]], building on the rich legacy of the previous disting incarnations, which can operate as  

- two souped-up [disting mk4](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/disting.html "Disting mk4")s, or as
- a single powerful module in its own right.

Fully DC-coupled, all inputs and outputs can be CVs or audio, depending on the selected function. The functions on offer include audio processing ([[Filter]]s, [[Delay]]s etc.), CV processing and generation ([[Quantizer]]s, pattern generators ([[Function generator]]) etc.), oscillators (VCOs ([[Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)]], LFOs ([[Low frequency oscillator (LFO)]]) etc.), and [[Sample playback]].  
  
Brand new features for the disting EX include an eight voice polyphonic [sample (WAV) player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytc8_5BhEIA), a powerful stereo [tape delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyBj-_lmln8) (based on our own [Augustus Loop](https://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/augustusloop.html "Augustus Loop")), and a dedicated WAV recorder mode. Since launch, new features have been added including a full-featured [polysynth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ytLfM9xyRY), a [granulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyebR_i_7CE), and implementations of the popular [Braids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0v6oM71lI), [Rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW-eh3waYo0), and [Plaits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh0qZlzUXq8) modules.
