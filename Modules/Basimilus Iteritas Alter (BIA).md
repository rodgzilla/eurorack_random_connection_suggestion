# Concept

[[Basimilus Iteritas Alter (BIA)]] is a parameterized digital drum synthesizer ([[Voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)]], [[Eurorack voice]], [[Eurorack module]]) with its roots in the analog world. At its heart, it is a simple six-oscillator additive synthesizer with adjustable waveform, harmonic spread and decay. Adjustable attack including a noise oscillator is also included. These are summed and fed into an infinifolder ([[Wavefolder]]) for crunch and variety.

[[Basimilus Iteritas Alter (BIA)]] is an improved version of Basimilus Iteritas. It is 2HP smaller, includes CV of switches, adds an third mode, and pitch range and knobs know offset rather than attenuate.
