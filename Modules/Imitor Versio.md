# Concept

**Stereo-in, stereo-out 12-tap multimode [[Delay]] with clock sync and tap tempo plus DSP platform.**

[[Imitor Versio]] is a delay designed for experimentation. With 12 delay taps and a slew of parameters designed to make the [[Delay]] perform in unfathomable ways, [[Imitor Versio]] is perfect for creating unusual echoes, playing with different [[Delay]] shapes and patterns, adding vintage flare to an atmosphere, and more.
