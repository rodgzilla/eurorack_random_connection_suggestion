# Concept

Unlock the full potential of your Alia with alternate firmwares, resources, and more.

Alia is a 10HP oscillator platform. Turn your module ([[Eurorack module]]) into one from the original Iteritas lineup, including Basimilus, Manis, Cursus, and Ataraxic Iteritas. Want something completely new? Try Debel Iteritas, an additive PM voice, or Incus Iteritas, a wavemangling percussion and instrument voice...or maybe even something completely different as new firmwares are released. Firmware is always free for Alia owners, so swap out your sound whenever you need a new vibe. Alia has something for everyone.
