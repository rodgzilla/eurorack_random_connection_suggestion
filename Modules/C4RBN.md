# Concept

[[C4RBN]] (pronounced "Carbon") is a 4/2-Pole State Variable [[Filter]] with input [[Saturation]], output wavefolding ([[Wavefolder]]), and more.  It features a wide range of character from nice and clean filter sounds to screaming, squelchy, acidic mayhem.    

[[C4RBN]] builds on WMD’s history with state-variable [[Filter]]s adding interface refinements and improved warm environment stability for live performance and beyond. A novel input [[Saturation]] circuit plus the output wavefolder from WMD’s classic [SYNCHRODYNE](https://wmdevices.com/products/synchrodyne) filter pair together to push the timbral flexibility to the next level. C4RBN is the building block to life in your [[Eurorack]] ([[Eurorack module]]).
